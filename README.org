* Description
  This is a repository of planetary structure code to work alongside ~Tidal.jl~.

* Design
  This contains two modules:
  - =Structure.jl=: planetary calculations such as gravity, density, and mass
    - =planet_cmu=: calculates the complex shear modulus of a planet based on the named models below
      - *Maxwell*
      - *Standard Linear Solid*
      - *Andrade*
  - =Planets.jl=: struct to initialize a planet with parameters
